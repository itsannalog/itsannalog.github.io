        <h1>Jacobus the Discord Bot</h1>
        <p>To help manage our growing communities at Stevens Esports and C2GS, I developed a custom Discord bot, Jacobus, to help make management a bit quicker. This bot, named after the old campus student center (which has since been torn down), allows users to self-assign roles, look at cat pictures, play games to earn points, and more. These points are compiled into a leaderboard, and the top 3 members at the end of each semester get prizes as a part of our community engagement efforts. Jacobus is currently servicing two servers and over 400 unique users. </p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>When I decided to make a Discord bot, I didn't know anything about JavaScript or Python, the two most popular languages for developing Discord bots. I decided to go for JavaScript for developing because it was applicable to web development, something I'm already learning about in my spare time. I was also interested in learning about Node.js for future projects. </p>
        <br><h3>Version 1.x.x</h3>
        <p>The beginning framework of the bot was created following <a href = "https://anidiots.guide/">An Idiot Guide's tutorial</a>. Once I had some basics programmed, I let my creativity determine the path of development. I knew I wanted self-assignable roles, so I found a quick YouTube tutorial for that. I also wanted to be able to schedule messages, since Discord still doesn't offer this natively. I found a JavaScript function that could set a timer, and I also learned how to get the current date and time. In general, learning Javascript in this way was fairly straightforward, and I found it easy to create new commands once I knew more about the functionality of Javascript and Discord.js. Development continued in this trial-and-error fashion until I ran into two major problems: Having one file for the whole bot was becoming a bit confusing and overwhelming, and I wanted certain commands to act differently depending on which server they were used in. </p>
        <br><h3>Version 2.x.x</h3>
        <p>First I made a Trello board to keep track of all the features I wanted to add and the bugs I encountered along the way. Then, back to YouTube I went, this time looking for command handler tutorials so I could clean up my code. It was much simpler than I expected to convert my existing file (then around 1000 lines) to a much cleaner format. It also allowed me to have a dynamic help command, as well as launch and relaunch individual commands without restarting the main process. This was especially exciting to me, as it meant less downtime for updates and I could fix bugs on the fly. I can even add completely new commands without taking the bot offline. <br>For the server-specific settings, I had a bit of trouble. It was suggested that I use SQL, but at the time, I didn't know anything about it and thought it was too overwhelming Eventually, I learned about JSON, and decided to store user data in a separate JSON file. The file is dynamic, and data for individual users is sorted by server. When a user leaves a server, their data for that server is deleted, and a new entry is only created when they send their first command. Server-specific settings are also stored in a JSON file, and include data like the welcome message, the name of the admin role, the server specific prefix, and the list of commands allowed on the server. Perhaps I will update the databases to use SQL in the future, but for now, JSON works fine.</p>
