        <h1>Sandwich Stacker</h1>
        <p>Sandwich Stacker is a browser game all about learning to make sandwiches. Using nothing but click controls, this game slowly teaches children how different combinations of ingredients can be used to create sandwiches. Geared towards students with special needs, this game is featured as part of <a href="https://lifeskillssoftware.tech/">Life Skills Software</a>'s game and analytic suite. </p>
        <br><h3>About the Game:</h3>
        <p>Sandwich Stacker was created as part of a Stevens Game Development Club game jam with the theme of education. Myself and Jake Lovrin decided to create a game targeted towards students with special needs, specifically learning disabilities, that teaches them how to make sandwiches. Inspired by a friend whose autistic younger brother was learning how to make sandwiches by himself, I suggested a Cooking Mama type game and we decided to use that idea. The game is now features as part of <a href="https://lifeskillssoftware.tech/">Life Skills Software</a>'s game and analytic suite, which has been recently launched in local schools. You can read Jake's development log <a href="https://jakeop4444.itch.io/sandwich-stacker/devlog/87874/stacker-devlog-1-completion">here.</a></p>
