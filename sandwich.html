        <h1>Sandwich Stacker</h1>
        <p>Sandwich Stacker is a browser game all about learning to make sandwiches. Using nothing but mouse controls, this game gradually teaches children how different combinations of ingredients can be used to create sandwiches. Geared towards students with special needs, this game is featured as part of <a href="https://lifeskillssoftware.tech/">Life Skills Software</a>'s game and analytic suite. </p>

        <h3>About Development</h3>
        <p>Sandwich Stacker was created as part of a Stevens Game Development Club game jam with the theme of education. Myself and Jake Lovrin decided to create a game targeted towards students with special needs, specifically learning disabilities, that teaches them how to make sandwiches. Making food is something we typically don't think about, but can prove to be challenging to those with disabilities. Inspired by a friend whose autistic younger brother was learning how to make sandwiches by himself, I suggested a Cooking Mama type game and we decided to use that idea. The game is now features as part of <a href="https://lifeskillssoftware.tech/">Life Skills Software</a>'s game and analytic suite, which has launched in local schools as a part of their special needs programs. You can read Jake's development log <a href="https://jakeop4444.itch.io/sandwich-stacker/devlog/87874/stacker-devlog-1-completion">here.</a></p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>Life Skills Software imposed very few requirements on us as developers in order to integrate with their software suite. We had to have a game controlled by only the keyboard and/or the mouse, and we had to export data about the user's play in order for the teachers to track student improvement. As the artist for this game, I decided to keep the style cartoony and flat to limit the amount of distractions for the user, but still vivid and bright enough to keep the user engaged. I had the biggest issues with the logo design and other text elements- I wanted it to be hand-drawn to fit the style, but clear enough for younger students to read. Overall, I think it turned out well. </p>
