            <div><p>My name is Anna, and I want to change the world. I'm a computer science student with a passion for video games, art, and music. Combine these talents and you get me, an amateur game developer. I've been involved in my school's video game club, C2GS, since I was admitted. It's one of the largest student organizations on campus, and I currently hold the treasurer position. Through C2GS, I manage all of the school's esports for games like Overwatch, Hearthstone, CS:GO, and Rocket League.</p>
            <p>I'm also involved in the video game development club, SGDC. I've participated in multiple game jams through the club since my freshman year. All of my game jam submissions as well as other game development projects can be seen on the Projects page, or on my <a href=https://annalog.itch.io>itch.io page</a>.</p></div>
