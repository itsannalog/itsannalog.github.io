        <h1>FORCE</h1>
        <p>The FORCE series started off as a game jam project, and in fact it was my very first game and game jam submission. FORCE has now evolved into much more than just a game jam build, featuring hand-drawn animations and several gamemodes.  Created with early contributions from <a href = https://waveparadigm.dev> Adam Gincel</a>, the FORCE series is now an ongoing project with the goal of becoming a finished, marketable product.</p>
        <br><h3>About the Game:</h3>
        <p>FORCE is a 2-4 player arena-style fighting game in which you can only kill your opponents by using the environment to your advantage. There are many ways to die, including by your own hand. Use your character's unique abilities to battle against your friends and determine the ultimate winner. To play, you will need at least one friend, one controller per player, and a Windows PC. No one is safe, ever!</p>
