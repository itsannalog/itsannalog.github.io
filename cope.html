        <h1>cope</h1>
        <p>cope is a single player platformer featuring world duality. It requires a Windows machine and a keyboard to play. Press space to jump, arrow keys to move left and right, and shift to see secret platforms as you navigate your brain through scary and dangerous places and back into your skull. </p>

        <br>
        <br><h3>About the Game:</h3>
        <p>cope was created during a 48 hour game jam to explore a small technical idea for a platmormer mechanic I thought would be interesting. Elements turn on and off and change the landscape of the level, presenting common platforming challenges (timed jumps, spiky obstacles) but with a creative twist uncommon to most platformers.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Meaning of 'cope'</h3>
        <p>My original plan for cope was to dive deep into the storyline, but in the context of the 48-hour game jam, this wasn't possible. In my original plans, an opening cutscene would introduce the characters- the brain, controlled by the player, and a young adult representing the person behind the controls. The player would have seen a short intro scene showing the young adult walking down an empty city street as the sky gets darker and darker. At some point, they would suddenly stop, look around, and look at the "camera" with a chilling message- "I need your help, I can't cope." The player would then be brought into the platforming game to pilot the young adult's brain back on track, to safety, to a happier place. An ending cutscene would resemble the opening, but with a sunrise in a field instead of a bleak cityscape. <br>Since I was more focused on using the world switching to create interesting levels, this original lore was cast aside for "later" implementation.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Level Design</h3>
        <p>I wanted the level progression to feel natural. Inspired by the Mario games, I tried to introduce the player to a particular mechanic through a simpler level or two, then use that mechanic as a part of a harder, more complex level later on. Because of the time constraint, I couldn't fully design super complex levels, but I still believe the mechanics are introduced and implemented in a way that feels natural to the user.</p>
